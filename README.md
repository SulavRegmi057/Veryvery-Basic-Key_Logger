# Veryvery-Basic-Key_Logger

# The realm of cybersecurity is rapidly expanding within the realm of computer science and the technology sector. Inadequate security measures have led to substantial global economic losses. Often, the root cause of such financial setbacks can be attributed to the vulnerability of keystrokes. Both enterprises and individual users often fall short in enforcing stringent keystroke protocols, similar to the guidelines recommended by the NIST (National Institute of Standard Technology). In the event of major security breaches, countless keystrokes can be exposed and archived.

# In addressing these challenges and advancing keystroke security, the focus of this project is to create a very basic key logger. The key logger will offer for efficiently capturing and managing keystrokes. With an emphasis on simplicity, this key logger will cater to both technical and non-technical users, facilitating a seamless experience.

# Veryvery-Basic-Key_Logger

# In addressing keystroke security, the focus of this project is to create a very basic key logger. The key logger will offer for efficiently capturing and managing keystrokes. With an emphasis on simplicity, this key logger will cater to both technical and non-technical users, facilitating a seamless experience.

# I would like to conclude that although this project serves as an example of a keylogger, it should only be used for ethical purposes.
